# Title: 
**User Story:** As we get older we are constantly experiencing new things and gaining new memories. What about the old? Well those memories tend to fade but when they are triggered we tend to relive those moments. This webpage is purely being created so we can rememeber. Our OWN memory history - a history of our youth and what we grew up listening to and watching. I hope you enjoy the walk down memory lane!

## Personal Daily Schedule and Goals:
1. Friday - Create all files, try to get skeleton built in the model & seeds
2. Saturday - Finish seeding data, Getting setup for express
3. Sunday - God even rests
4. Monday - Work on the controllers and focus on CRUD
5. Tuesday - Set up the HTML page, add the needed client functions in our index.js.
6. Wednesday - Begin CSS on the main page
7. Thursday - Make sure pages are communicating and wrap up finishing touches in CSS.

### Technologies used:
1. Javascript
2. CSS
3. HTMl
5. Mongoose
6. Express.js
7. Cors
8. Axios/Api
9. ThunderClient
10. Morgan & Body-Parser

### Steps to making the code:
1. Spend time whiteboarding, coming up with what information you want displayed on your page, and what your seed files will need to look like.
2. Think about the functionability of the page to help you design your wireframe.
2. Create an wireframe outline for your webpage.
3. Start with creating a repo in your github and cloning the file into your terminal.
4. After creating the file in your terminal we will begin installing the software we will be implementing.
5. Look to your wireframing and design to create the files we will need to seed the code.
6. Proceed with connecting all models, to seeds, to controllers and making sure they are communicating with one another.
7. Create CRUD functions on our backend and begin creating our frontend files.
8. Link the frontend files accordingly and have them extract the data from our backend.
9. Beginning adding functions to our front end that allow us to target our backend.
10. Make the functions concise and run them in the terminal to check their function.
11. After checking that the pages are operating the way desired and the correct data is being pulled clean up any unused code.
